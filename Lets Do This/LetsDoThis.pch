// Include any system framework and library headers here that should be included in all compilation units.
// You will also need to set the Prefix Header build setting of one or more of your targets to reference this file.

// Note that removing the Foundation and UIKit headers from here may not break the app--those headers are also imported through CocoaPods.
// The #import directive only #include(s) a file when that file has not been included before, and it replaces that directive with the
// entire content of the specified header. We keep the Foundation and UIKit headers here for safety and clarity.
